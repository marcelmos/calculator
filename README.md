## Project usage

To use calculator you can press buttons on virtual keyboard or using your own keyboard (I prefer number keyboard keys).

`C` button clear your calculator equation to 0. <br/>
`+/-` button surrounds the entered number with parentheses and sets its sign `-`
> Example:<br />
Input: 5 [+/-] [+] 8 [+] 12.2 [+/-] [+] 1.8 [+/-] [+] 4 [=]<br />
Resault: (-5) + 8 + (-12.2) + (-1.8) + 4


`=` button is count your current equation, then final value is added as a only one value (previous equation is cleared). This allow you to continue input values with a previous result.

## Note for developer

- Real time equation end resault display
- Prevent from input multiple signs [`, or .`, `/`, `*`, `+`, `-`, `%`]
- Add small border radius on bottom left and right corner
